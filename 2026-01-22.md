## What I Learned Today
- Today I set up my GitHub SSH & created my first repository.
- Learned more about what exactly a Git is, how GitHub works and why its useful.
- Learned how to add, commit, push and why they matter
- Outside of this I did some solid networking, recieved a message back with someone starting with a .careers page they sent, and sent out some good connections.

## Tomorrow's Goal
- Automate add, commit, push.
- Create some different repos on GitHub.
- Continue networking.


## Career Thoughts
- I made my "grok" auto task for some news updates, but I think a good project for me would be to code an automated news thing for my interestes & career interests
- Lit off first engine on FDD today - nice.
- Keep getting creative on networking
- Enjoying playing around with all of this stuff.
