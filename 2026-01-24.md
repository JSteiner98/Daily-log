# Daily Log: 2026-01-24

## What I Learned Today
- Automated my git upload with command "gcp" for daily logs or whatever else
- Downloaded python v 3.11.7 & created a segregated folder and "environment" penv

## Tomorrow's Goal
- We'll see - probably something with python?
- I think I should learn more about this entire system and basics before moving forward too fast? 
- Also, I want to keep moving forward on this to maintain my interest - its more fun doing the cool stuff
- My main goal with wanting to go back to some of the basics is so that I understand where I am and how to fix mistakes more easily - I want to feel like all the lights are on in the house that I'm inside of - not like I'm stumbling into the bedroom in the pitch black

## Career Thoughts
- I think its cool learning the best practices for the different segregated "environments" to not disturb other areas and keep everything safe and secure
- Working 7 days a week lately and also being consistent with this stuff is hard but I'm glad I'm making progress so far
