## What I Learned Today
- Today - and the last week or so, I started my Defense Brief/News feed automation
- I have a working python script that researches defense news on selected sources and sends me an email after scraping and rating them
- So far everything has been written with Gemini but I started to research using Claude
- I want to expand the program to scrape a bunch of websites and other sources and additionally create an app that analyzes trends

## Tomorrow's Goal
- Possibly start using Claude Code
- Implement new features and add websites to the list to scrape more
- Need to get back to being more consistent

## Career Thoughts
- Received bad news on my career transition, but still have opportunities on the outlook
- I think getting this process and creating this project will be not only useful but a good thing to show recruiters 
- I think I need to start focusing on some PM specific courses and stuff too
