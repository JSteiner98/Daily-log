# Daily Log: 2026-01-25

## What I Learned Today
- Today I did a lot of review of what I learned previously
- I changed my "TerminalCommands.md" cheat sheet into a cheat sheet for terminal, git, VSC, python, etc.
- I feel better about catching up on some of my basics, but still trying to wrap my head around everything 

## Tomorrow's Goal
- Continue reaffirming basics, I feel like I need to create a map of where exactly I'm at; maybe a cool project I could try to make?
- Maybe start with some python stuff, I also feel like once I start making stuff/projects, the basics questions will start to become more clear

## Career Thoughts
- I think this is creating a good mindset for me in relation to the goals I'm going after
- FDD Cert start tomorrow + hopefully start studying some America specs
- Confirmed call for 2026-01-28 Wednesday with contact from LinkedIn
