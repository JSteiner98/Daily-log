## What I Learned Today
- Didn't do much learning on this stuff today, but still wanted to log something
- I did recieve a call from a recruiter today & I recieved a message back from a relatively cold Linkedin connection
- 

## Tomorrow's Goal
- Automate add, commit, push.
- Create some different repos on GitHub.

## Career Thoughts
- Really hope something comes from this Linkedin connection, they're supposed to schedule time for some time next week to chat
- lit off second engine today for FDD, so much closer to being done with FDD project
- Still need to continue to push on this career transition thing
