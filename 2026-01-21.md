# Daily Log: 2026-01-21

## What I Learned Today
- I learned how to make a function in terminal to properly create a "new log and have it automatically format how I want it.
- I learned that macs are pretty hard to break doing stuff like this and I made a "Developer" folder where I'll keep all of this stuff.
- I made a GitHub account, but I didn't link it yet.

## Tomorrow's Goal
- Link my GitHub account
- Automate turning each log into Git as Gemini suggested
- Explore Github a bit and accomplish some of the daily practice stuff previously suggested

## Career Thoughts
- This is good, but need to do more networking in general
- I followed up with a few previous contacts today but I need to start thinking outside of the box...
