## What I Learned Today
- today I did a lot and its late so I'm not going to give an in depth update
- I downloaded claude-code, upgraded to claude pro, started editing my defense brief program with claude-code, added multiple RSS sources, ready to run new code tomorrow

## Tomorrow's Goal
- review everything I've done and figure out exactly where I'm at with claude code and make sure everything is cleaned up
- touch base with all my skills and really understand what I'm doing with claude so I don't get too far out in front of my skis

## Career Thoughts
- moving fast on this - feels good, but as mentioned, want to understand basics more than anything.
