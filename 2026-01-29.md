## What I Learned Today
- Today I successfully downloaded Ollama and integrated Llama3.2 onto my computer
- I created a couple python scripts including a "field_analyst.py" that uses llama3.2 as a "senior defense" analyst
- The system directive portion of the llama advisor was really cool

## Tomorrow's Goal
- Start learning how to create something with llama that's actually applicable/useful to my life at the moment
- Continue momentum with llama learning and integration on my computer

## Career Thoughts
- Meeting with first LinkedIn contact tomorrow @ 1000
- Meeting with second LinkedIn contact Tuesday @ 1830
- Been a very busy week - prepping for calls above and completing FDD certification
- Completed FDD cert today - successful baring a few discrepancies to be corrected before docking
