**Focus:** Terminal & Linux Basics

## What I learned today:
* The difference between a GUI (mouse) and a CLI (terminal).
* Why Unix/Linux is the backbone of defense systems (stability & security).
* Basic navigation: `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, and `touch`.
* This summary is pretty much just Gemini's summary of what I learned today. I learned a some of this, but I'm still needing to go back to basics on this.
* 

## Tomorrow's Goal:
* Master the "Path" concept and move files between folders using `mv`.
* Why or how does network/software security play into this?
* How can I continue this without screwing up my Mac? On PC I feel like every download and messing around with the system you do risks messing it up.
* Create a GitHub account and link to computer

## Career Thought:
* How could "version control" help track ship repair change orders at NASSCO?
* I'm learning using my own path, need to make sure I stay committed to this so that I can make this useful and be able to talk to it smartly.
