## What I Learned Today
- Adjusted the defense news brief today with claude code
- We changed the API model to llama so the entire program runs locally now - it works very well now, but the grading has a little less nuance with llama
- I also learned today that CC can be used pretty well for sugggesting edits and running efficiently

## Tomorrow's Goal
- Next on the defense brief I want to refine the search criteria and possibly implement some more gov sources
- Before I get too deep I'd like to have CC create a "learning visualization" of how the code works - something I can study and show to people to explain
- Also want to implement the app, but want to get the program a little more polished
