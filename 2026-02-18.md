## What I Learned Today
- As per ClaudeCode:
  - Committed and pushed the Ollama/keyword scoring overhaul from last session                        
  - Built the architecture diagram generator with a title block, color-coded phases, and legend       
  - Added requirements.txt and .vscode/settings.json to keep the dev environment clean      
- Happy with diagram CC made with Graphviz to explain architecture of the code so far.
- Cool to see how much CC can actually do, even with my minimal experience

## Tomorrow's Goal
- Continue fine tuning on scoring for the defense news brief
- Want to cut down on the number of contracts returned and increase the number of articles for each - most recently we've been returning 2 articles and 8 contracts

## Career Thoughts
- I want to continue to build out the defense news brief and make it useful to myself and also something I can show off
- Networking still going strong, talked to "outside counsel" and also received an informal offer from someone
- Have call scheduled for Monday still
